            <strong>Less obvious perks of using 'live' data resources include logins and payments. How could Twitter be used in these two scenarios?</strong><br>
Companies realize that social media can help promote their products by reaching a large audience without<br>
spending a penny. To this end, being able to quickly access a users information makes API resources invaluable.<br>
Being able to seamlessly transfer user info through the various API’s out there gives giant advantages<br>
when drawing in and retaining users who just want a simple interface.<br>
<strong>Login-</strong>By a user allowing their login information to be recorded, it allows companies<br>
to track the users movements, likes, dis-likes and can make for a unique marketing tool when spreading<br>
a companies message. Companies can allow the same user login info to their site and make it simpler and <br>
easier for users to move along.<br>			

<strong>Payment-</strong>By storing users “payment type” data, companies make it easier for a user to <br>
simply say yes to previously stored payment-type information to purchase goods and services. Eliminating the<br>
hassle of filling out billing information and credit card numbers every time increases the chance of a user <br>
purchasing a product or service because it’s just easier for them.<br> 

<strong>Visit Programmableweb.com and search for JSON-P data sources. Why would we need JSON-P, specifically?</strong>
When domains communicate with each other they follow the ‘Same Origin’ policy which prohibits their interaction <br>
between each other. This is mostly for the purpose of security. Not allowing one domain affect another.<br>
The usefulness of JSON-P in this instance allows a payload of JSON data to be transferred from one API to another.<br>
The “P”, which stands for padding, is function that is “wrapped” around the data. This allows the self contained <br>
function the ability to parse the data using javascript. Sending the information with a function allows any other <br>
API the ability to render ANY JSON data because the function needed to display the data is already included.<br>

<strong>JSON-P analogy</strong>
JSON =a new un-assembled bike with assembly directions written in Chinese.<br>
-P=is a Chinese speaking mechanic that’s included with the bike and assembles<br>
it for you so you don’t need to figure out how to read the directions.<br>
<strong>Based on the JSON-P search results: what data resource(s) do you think might pair well with which types of Native device features?</strong><br>
A few months ago President Obama signed an FAA bill that gives the go-ahead to draw up rules to integrate drones into <br>
the country's airspace by October 2015. I had done some research and discovered a few companies that are capitalizing <br>
on this new trend by creating drones that can be controlled by smartphones.This would be an excellent example of how <br>
JSON-P could be useful. Having JSON data sent with the function calls included would make it easier for ANY smartphone<br>
to utilize it’s own native accelerometer to control a drones movements.<br>

<strong>Please describe any design and functionality intentions you may have for your Demo app components this month.</strong>
I am going the simple route this month. I am still learning how to successfully use CSS in designing great interfaces<br>
so having a Twitter feed and a weather app might be the extent of my apps components. The possibilities are endless,<br>
especially when one thinks of combining some of these unique features to accomplish a variety of tasks.<br>
<strong>Briefly describe some past 'lessons learned' regarding workflow as it relates to research, design, development, etc.</strong><br>

As I reflect on lessons learned in regards to the workflow of design and development, I can’t help but be<br>
tied to old constraints. Doing research on the effective implementation of code vastly differs from research<br>
that you would do on an essay or term paper.

I’ve learned that along the path of understanding code and how to utilize it comes a wealth of information<br>
that offers many different angles and answers to the same problem. Sometimes there is no exact answer when<br>
researching code. When researching about history, science or politics, there is only one answer and much<br>
like a coder, the facts must be put together into a report that can be understood by everybody and can convey<br>
the thoughts of the writer. I’ve learned to try and adapt this mentality when writing effective code.<br>
Being someone with a writing background and little coding experience, I’ve tried to implement systems<br>
that I already use into a tool that will help write more effective code.<br>
